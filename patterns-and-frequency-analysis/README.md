# 🧬 Assignment 1 – Pattern Finding & Frequency Analysis

This notebook includes my solutions to the first set of bioinformatics problems, focused mainly on analyzing patterns in DNA sequences. All tasks were solved using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📘 What’s Inside

1. **Pattern Finding** – Finding all exact occurrences of a given k-mer (substring) in a DNA string.

2. **Frequent Words** – Identifying the most common k-mers in a DNA sequence.

3. **Minimum Skew** – Locating positions in the genome where the skew (difference between G and C counts) is lowest.

4. **Frequent Words with Mismatches** – A tougher version of the frequent words problem that allows mismatches.

5. **DnaA Box in *Salmonella enterica*** – Searching for the DnaA binding site in a real genome sequence.

## 📁 Files

- `assignment1-bioinformatics.ipynb` – The main notebook with code, explanations, and results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Built-in libraries like `collections` and `itertools`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repo  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter  
3. Run each cell to see the outputs
