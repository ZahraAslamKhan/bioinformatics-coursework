# 🧬 Assignment 2 – Motif Finding Algorithms

This notebook contains my implementations of two classic motif-finding algorithms used in bioinformatics. These are fundamental for identifying patterns that appear across multiple DNA sequences.

## 📘 What’s Inside

1. **Median String Algorithm**  
   Finds the k-length string (median string) that minimizes the total Hamming distance to all strings in a given collection.

2. **Greedy Motif Search**  
   An approximation algorithm to find motifs in multiple DNA sequences by choosing the most likely motifs step by step.

## 📁 Files

- `assignment2-motif-search.ipynb` – Contains code, explanations, and test examples for both algorithms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Used basic Python logic and string handling (no external libraries needed)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo  
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter  
3. Run each cell to test the algorithms and see the results
